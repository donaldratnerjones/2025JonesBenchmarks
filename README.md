This repository provides two benchmark test problems for constrained global optimization with high-dimensional black-box functions.  Both benchmarks are based on real-world problems and do not have the artificial complexity characteristic of many standard test problems.  By publishing MATLAB code for these problems, I hope to encourage the optimization community to develop algorithms that can solve problems with realistic size/complexity.  The benchmark problems will hopefully also provide a basis for comparing the performance of new proposed algorithms.  

See the file Benchmarks/Benchmarks.pdf for a full description of the provided benchmark test problems.  The file Benchmarks/example.m solves the two benchmarks with MATLAB's "surrogateopt" optimization algorithm (available in the global optimization toolbox) and can be used as a model for how to solve the benchmarks with other optimizers.
